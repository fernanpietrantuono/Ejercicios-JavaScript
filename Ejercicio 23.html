      Always had a fear of being typical. Looking at my body feeling miserable.
      Always hanging on to the visual. I wanna be invisible. Looking at my years
      like a martyrdom. Everybody needs to be a part of 'em. Never be enough,
      I'm the prodigal son. I was born to run, I was born for this.
      Hypocritical, egotistical. Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical.
      Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box. An epoxy to
      the world and the vision we've lost. I'm an apostrophe, I'm just a symbol
      to remind you that there's more to see. I'm just a product of the system,
      a catastrophe, And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased. And when
      I am deceased. At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily. And
      leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee. I do what it takes.
      Whatever it takes. 'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins. I do whatever
      it takes. 'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains. Whatever it
      takes. Yeah, take me to the top I'm ready for whatever it takes. 'Cause I
      love the adrenaline in my veins. I do what it takes.
